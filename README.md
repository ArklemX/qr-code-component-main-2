## My process

  To reach the end of this Challenge, i made it like this :
- Structure With HTML: I begun by making the structure of the product. I think that it is much simple. 
- Style With CSS : Next , i continuously adjusted the CSS to reach the goal i'd.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

Right now , i know i still have to learn about

- FlexBox

### Useful resources

- [How_to_center_the_card_?]( https://css-tricks.com/quick-css-trick-how-to-center-an-object-exactly-in-the-center/ ) - This helped me to understand how i could actually center my center. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward. Right now, the card is on the center of the screen , regardless of the device.
- [FlexBox](https://yoksel.github.io/flex-cheatsheet/) - This is an amazing sheet cheat which helped me finally understand how to work with Flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept:).
